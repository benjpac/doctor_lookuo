## Description

Doctor Lookup
Achoo! As we all know, everybody needs to see a doctor sometimes. But finding a doctor that provides the services you need nearby can be time consuming. To facilitate this, you have been asked to create a website where users may enter a medical issue (ie: “sore throat”, "rash", etc.) into a form, submit it, and receive a list of doctors nearby who can treat their medical issue. Cool!

To provide the data you need for this application, Epicodus has partnered with one of the leading providers of medical data - the BetterDoctor API. You'll use the BetterDoctor API to retrieve this information. This is a live API by a Series A funded startup currently under active development, and used by industry heavy-hitters such as HealthNet to provide accurate medical data._
